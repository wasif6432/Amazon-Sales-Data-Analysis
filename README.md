## Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
#
### Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of Amazon's sales data using Python for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and key performance indicators to provide actionable insights into sales performance across different regions, product categories, and time periods.
#
### Project Description
In this project, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon's sales dataset. The analysis includes:

- Descriptive statistics  
- Distribution plots  
- Correlation analysis  
- Time series analysis  
- Category-wise analysis  
- Regression analysis  
#

The insights from the analysis are visualized using Tableau, providing a comprehensive dashboard that highlights key metrics and trends.

### Analysis and Visualizations
The analysis includes:

- Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics of numerical variables.  
- Distribution Plots: Histograms and box plots for key numerical variables.  
- Correlation Analysis: Heatmap and pair plots to show relationships between variables.  
- Time Series Analysis: Line graphs for monthly and yearly trends in revenue and profit.  
- Category-wise Analysis: Bar charts for average profit by region, item type, and sales channel.  
- Regression Analysis: Examining the relationship between unit price and total revenue.  

The Tableau dashboard provides interactive visualizations, including:

- Monthly online and offline revenue and profit trends
- Top 10 countries by revenue, profit, and expenditure
- Global sales distribution map
- Units sold by month
